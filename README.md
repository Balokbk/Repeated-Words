<h1 align='center'>Repeated Words</h1>
This is a little program that i made during a NodeJS course.<br>
I used pure JS and some modules.
<h2>Modules</h2>
-Fs(File system) => The program read and create a .txt file, so i needed to use it.<br>
-Commander => This module helps to use the program more easily, so you can use the -t(or --text) and -d(or --destiny) to use the paths more easily.<br>
-Chalk => Just to have some collors to help the understanding of the resultes.<br>
<h2>How to use?</h2>
First you need the NodeJS in your computer, open the root folder to the project in any cmd that you want to use it.<br>
Run the program using 'node ./src/cli.js' followed by '-t < insert here the path and the text in .txt >' and '-d < insert here the path where the file will be processed >'<br>
Example: node .\src\cli.js -t .\archives\test.txt -d .\resultFolder\
